    "# Generate Water Body Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this notebook do?** This notebook uses output `NetCDF` files of WOFS summaries from `datacube-stats` to generate polygons of water bodies in the landscape. This code follows the following workflow:\n",
    "* Generate a list of netCDF files within a specified folder location\n",
    "* Opens each netCDF file and:\n",
    "    * Keep only pixels identified as wet at least x% of the time\n",
    "    * Convert the raster data into polygons\n",
    "    * Filter the polygons based on size\n",
    "    * Remove polygons that intersect with Australia's coastline and estuaries\n",
    "    * Remove erroneous 'water' polygons within high-rise CBD areas\n",
    "    * Optional filtering for proximity to major rivers (as identified by the Geofabric dataset)\n",
    "* Append the polygon set to a shapefile\n",
    "* Remove artificial polygon borders created at tile boundaries by merging polygons that intersect across Albers Tile boundaries\n",
    "* Save out the final polygon set to a shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required inputs:** \n",
    "* NetCDF files with WOfS outputs that will be used to define the persistent water body polygons\n",
    "    * Variable name: `TileFolder`\n",
    "* A coastline polygon to filter out polygons generated from ocean pixels.\n",
    "    * Here we use the [GEODATA COAST 100K 2004 dataset](https://data.gov.au/dataset/geodata-coast-100k-2004)\n",
    "* Estuary data layer to supplement the coastline polygon, which does not identify estuaries as 'ocean'\n",
    "    * Here we generated this layer from the [OzCoasts Geomorphic habitat datasets](http://www.ozcoasts.gov.au/search_data/datasets.jsp). Each of the state datasets were downloaded, and only `channel` and `Central Basin` features were retained. These correspond to the locations of open water (including large river channels) within estuary systems.\n",
    "* Urban\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Optional inputs**\n",
    "* River line dataset for filtering out polygons comprised of river segments.\n",
    "    * Here we use the [Bureau of Meteorology's Geofabric v 2.1.1 (Suface Hydrology Network)](ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/home/geofabric/), filtered to only keep features tagged as `major rivers`. \n",
    "    * There are some identified issues with this data layer that make the filtering using this data inconsistent (see [the discussion below](#rivers)\n",
    "    * We therefore turn this off during the production of the water bodies shapefile. \n",
    "    * The option to filter out major rivers is provided, and so this dataset is optional if `FilterOutRivers = False`.\n",
