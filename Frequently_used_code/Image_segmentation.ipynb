    "### Background\n",
    "In the last two decades, as the spatial resolution of satellite images has increased, remote sensing has begun to shift from a focus on pixel-based analysis towards Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), which aims to group pixels together into meaningful image-objects. There are two advantages to a GEOBIA worklow; one, we can reduce the 'salt and pepper' effect typical of classifying pixels; and two, we can increase the computational efficiency of our workflow by grouping pixels into fewer, larger, but meaningful objects. A review of the emerging trends in GEOBIA can be found [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15481603.2018.1426092)."

    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates two methods for conducting `image segmentation`, which is a common image analysis technique used to transform a digital satellite image into objects. In brief, [image segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) aims to partition an image into segments, where each segment consists of a group of pixels with similar characteristics. A number of algorithms exist to perform image segmentation, two of which are shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Quickshift](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.segmentation.html#skimage.segmentation.quickshift), implemented through the python package `scikit-image`\n",
    "2. [Shepherd Segmentation](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/6/658), implemented through the package `rsgislib`\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Image segmentation at very large scales can be both time and memory intensive, and the the examples shown here will become prohibitively time consuming at scale. The notebook [Tiled, Parallel Image Segmentation](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/blob/chad/segmentation/parallel_segmentation.ipynb) builds upon the image segmentation algorithm developed by Shepherd et al. (2019) to run image segmentation across multiple cpus."
