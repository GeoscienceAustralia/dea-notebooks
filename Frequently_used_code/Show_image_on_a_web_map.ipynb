    "    4. Run Menu: `File > Close and halt`\n",

    "If you re-run any cells and then save widget state you might end up with stale widget state present in the notebook document as well, that state won't be displayed but will significantly increase your notebook on-disk size, preventing tools like nbviewer from rendering it.\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that `clear widget state` only removes it from the notebook file, not from your browser, so next time you run `save widget state` stale state will re-appear on disk.\n",
    "To make sure that stale `widget state` is properly gone you have to reload the notebook in your browser after clearing it."
