Frequently used code
====================

These notebooks feature code-snippets that are applicable to many analyses.

These notebooks should:

* Be as short as possible

* Include simple, reproducible examples of commonly used tasks

* The end goal is to create a `recipe book` of useful code that users can copy-paste into their analyses
