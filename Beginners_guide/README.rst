# Beginner's guide

The Beginners Guide contains introductory notebooks aimed at introducing Jupyter Notebooks, Digital Earth Australia (DEA), how to load, plot and interact with data from DEA. These notebooks are designed to be worked through in the following order:


- 1. [Jupyter Notebooks](01_Jupyter_notebooks.ipynb)
- 2. [Digital Earth Australia](02_DEA.ipynb)
- 3. [Products and Measurements](03_Products_and_measurements.ipynb)
- 4. [Loading data](04_Loading_data.ipynb)
- 5. [Plotting](05_Plotting.ipynb)
- 6. [Performing a basic analysis](06_Basic_analysis.ipynb)
- 7. [Introduction to numpy](07_Intro_to_numpy.ipynb)
- 8. [Introduction to xarray](08_Intro_to_xarray.ipynb)
- 9. [Parallel processing with Dask](09_Parallel_processing_with_dask.ipynb)

Once you have you have completed the beginner tutorials, join advanced users in exploring:

* The "Datasets" directory in the repository, where you can explore DEA products in depth.
* The "Frequently used code" directory, which contains a recipe book of common techniques and methods for analysing DEA data.
* The "Real-world examples" directory, which provides more complex workflows and analysis case studies.
