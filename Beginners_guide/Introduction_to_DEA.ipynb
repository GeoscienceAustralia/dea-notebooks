    "Digital Earth Australia (DEA) is a digital platform that catalogues large amounts of Earth Observation data covering continental Australia.\n",
    "It is implemented using the open source software collection of the Open Data Cube (ODC) which has an ever growing list of users, implementations and contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ODC and DEA platforms are designed to:\n",
    "* Catalogue large amounts of Earth Observation data\n",
    "* Provide a Python based API for high performance querying and data access\n",
    "* Give scientists and other users easy ability to perform exploratory data analysis\n",
    "* Allow scalable continent scale processing of the stored data\n",
    "* Track the provenance of all the contained data to allow for quality control and updates\n",
    "\n",
    "The DEA program catalogues data from a range of satellite sensors and has adopted processes and terminology that users should be aware of to enable efficient querying and use of the datasets stored within.\n",
    "This notebook introduces these important concepts and forms the basis of understanding for the remainder of the notebooks in this Beginners Guide.\n",
    "Resources to further explore these concepts are recommended at the end of the notebook."

    "### Satellite datasets \n",
    "Digital Earth Australia catalogues data from a range of satellite sensors. \n",
    "The earliest datasets of optical satellite imagery in DEA date from 1986.\n",
    "Overall, DEA includes data from:\n",
    "* Landsat 5 TM, operational between March 1984 and January 2013\n",
    "* Landsat 7 ETM+, operational since April 1999\n",
    "* Landsat 8 OLI, operational since February 2013\n",
    "* Sentinel 2A MSI, operational since June 2015\n",
    "* Sentinel 2B MSI, operational since March 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "The Landsat missions are jointly operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n",
    "The Sentinel missions are operated by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets generated by each of these sensors (satellites) are subtly different.\n",

    "> Figure 1 shows the recent Landsat satellites and Sentinel sensors and compares the way they sample the electromagnetic spectrum (Wavelength axis). \n",
    "The figure is overlaid upon the percent transmission of each wavelength returned to the atmosphere from the Earth relative to the original amount of solar radiation. \n",
    "The bands that are detected by each of the satellites are shown in the numbered boxes and the width of each box is relative to the range of wavelengths that band detects.\n",
    "The y-axis has no bearing on the comparison of the satellite sensors.\n",
    "Note that Landsat 5 TM contained 7 bands which measured the same regions as bands 1 to 7 on LS7 ETM+.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the numbering of the bands relative to the detected wavelengths between sensors is inconsistent (Figure 1).\n",
    "Note also that the width of the detected bands between sensors is also inconsistent.\n",
    "For this reason, it is important to remember that the DEA data comes from multispectral sensors and that when you search.........\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum (around 560 nm), LS5 TM and LS7 ETM+ detect a wide green region called band 2. \n",
    "LS8 OLI detects a slightly narrower region and calls it band 3.\n",
    "Sentinel 2 MSI (A and B) detect a narrow green region but also call it band 3.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* The standardised SR data products deliver calibrated optical surface reflectance data across land and coastal fringes.\n",

    "* Radiance measurements from EO sensors do not directly quantify the surface reflectance of the Earth. Such measurements are modified by variations in atmospheric\n",
    "  properties, sun position, sensor view angle, surface slope and surface aspect.\n",
    "  To obtain consistent and comparable measures of Earth surface reflectance from EO,these variations need to be reduced or removed from the radiance measurements (Li et al., 2010).\n",
    "  This is especially important when comparing imagery acquired in different seasons and geographic regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The SR product is created using a physics-based, coupled BRDF and atmospheric correction model that can be applied to both flat and inclined surfaces (Li et al., 2012).\n",

    "* For anisotropic surfaces, the radiance received at the satellite sensor from a sloping surface is also affected by surface\n",

    "  azimuth angle) as well as topographic geometry (primarily slope and aspect angles).\n",
    "  Consequently, to obtain comparable surface reflectance from satellite images covering mountainous areas,\n",
    "  it is necessary to process the images to reduce or remove the topographic effect so that the images can be used for different purposes on the same spectral base.\n",

    "PQ25 is an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation\n",
    "of the Earth surface and also whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. The PQ product allows\n",
    "users to produce masks which can be used to exclude pixels which do not meet their quality criteria from analysis .\n",
    "The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for emerging multi-temporal analysis techniques that\n",
    "make use of every quality assured pixel within a time series of observations.Users can choose to process only land pixels,\n",
    "or only sea pixels depending on their analytical requirements, leading to enhanced computationally efficient.\n",

    "    * Saturation in any band\n",
    "    * Presence of cloud\n",
    "    * Presence of cloud shadow\n",
    "    * Land or sea\n",
    "\n",
    "As Landsat Imagery becomes more readily available, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of analyses undertaken\n",
    "by researchers around the globe.  Most researchers use some form of quality masking schema in order to remove undesirable\n",
    "pixels from analysis, whether that be cloud, cloud shadow, observations over the ocean, or  saturated pixels.  In the past,\n",
    "researchers would reject partly cloud-affected scenes in favour of cloud-free scenes.  However, Landsat time series analysis\n",
    "using all cloud-free pixels has become a valuable technique and has increased the demand for automation of cloud, cloud\n",
    "shadow and saturation detection.  Emergency response applications such as flood mapping typically have to contend with\n",
    "individual cloud affected scenes and therefore rely on effective cloud and cloud shadow removal techniques.\n",

    "The PQ25 product combines established algorithms that detect clouds including the Automated Cloud Cover Assessment\n",
    "(ACCA) (Irish et al. 2006) and Function of mask (Fmask) (Zhu and Woodcock 2012) . ACCA is already widely used within the\n",
    "remote sensing community; it is fast and relatively accurate.  Fmask on the other hand is newer, but is rapidly becoming\n",
    "more established, and can provide a more accurate cloud mask than ACCA in certain cloud environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different sensor designs of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI all have\n",
    "different sensor saturation characteristics. The PQ25 layer enables users to exclude\n",
    "observations from a given band where the pixels are saturated (exceed the dynamic range\n",
    "of the sensor). The per-band saturation information in PQ allows users to exclude pixels\n",
    "where their specific band of interest is saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PQ 25 layer uses two industry standard cloud/cloud shadow detection algorithms to\n",
