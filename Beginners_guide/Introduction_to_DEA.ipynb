    "### General advice (delete this cell before submitting for review)\n",
    "\n",
    "- When choosing a location for your analysis, **select an area that has data on both the `NCI` and `DEA Sandbox`** to allow your code to be run on both environments. \n",
    "For example, you can check this for Landsat using the [DEA Explorer](https://explorer.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/ga_ls5t_ard_3/1990) (use the drop-down menu to view all products). \n",
    "As of September 2019, the `DEA Sandbox` has a single year of continental Landsat data for 2015-16, and the full 1987-onward time-series for three locations (Perth WA, Brisbane QLD, and western NSW).\n",
    "- When writing in Markdown cells, start each sentence is on a **new line**.\n",
    "This makes it easy to see changes through git commits.\n",
    "- Use Australian English in markdown cells and code comments.\n",
    "- Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "- In the final notebook cell, include a set of relevant tags which are used to build the DEA User Guide's [Tag Index](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/genindex.html). \n",
    "Use all lower-case, seperate words with spaces, and where possible re-use existing tags.\n",
    "Ensure the tags cell below is in `Raw` format, rather than `Markdown` or `Code`.\n"

    "Digital Earth Australia (DEA) is a platform designed to:\n",
    "* Catalogue large amounts of Earth Observation data\n",
    "* Provide a Python based API for high performance querying and data access\n",
    "* Give scientists and other users easy ability to perform exploratory data analysis\n",
    "* Allow scalable continent scale processing of the stored data\n",
    "* Track the provenance of all the contained data to allow for quality control and updates\n",

    "* Landsat 5 (LS5), operational between March 1984 and January 2013\n",
    "* Landsat 7 (LS7), operational since April 1999\n",
    "* Landsat 8 (LS8), operational since February 2013\n",

    "\n",
    "The spatial resolution also varies between the Landsat and Sentinel programs.\n",

    "This means that as the number of bands has increased on more contemporary satellites, the detected regions of the EMS do not correlate by band number when comparing between sensors.\n",
