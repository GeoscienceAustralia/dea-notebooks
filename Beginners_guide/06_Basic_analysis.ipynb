    "It will combine many of the steps that have been covered in the other beginner's notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the analysis question is \"how is the health of vegetation changing over time for two different test locations?\".\n",
    "This could be related to a number of broader questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the effect of a particular fertilizer on a field of crops?\n",
    "* How has a patch of forest changed after a fire? \n",
    "* How does proximity to water affect vegetation throughout the year?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, the analysis question will be kept simple, without much real-world context. \n",
    "For more examples of notebooks that demonstrate how to use DEA to answer specific analysis questions, see the notebooks in the \"Real world examples\" folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Topics covered in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choosing a study area and two test locations\n",
    "2. Exploring available data products for the area\n",
    "3. Loading the chosen data\n",
    "4. Plotting the chosen data and exploring how it changes with time\n",
    "5. Calculating a measure of vegetation health from the loaded data\n",
