    "Digital Earth Australia catalogues data from a range of satellite sensors. \n",
    "The earliest datasets of optical satellite imagery in DEA date from 1986.\n",
    "DEA includes data from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Landsat 5 TM](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-5?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con) (LS5 TM), operational between March 1984 and January 2013\n",

    "* [Landsat 8 OLI](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-8?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con) (LS8 OLI), operational since February 2013\n",
    "* [Sentinel 2A MSI](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) (S2A MSI), operational since June 2015\n",
    "* [Sentinel 2B MSI](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) (S2B MSI, operational since March 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Landsat missions are jointly operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n",
    "Sentinel missions are operated by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "One major difference between the two programs is the spatial resolution: each Landsat pixel represents 30 x 30 m on the ground while each Sentinel-2 pixel represents 10 x 10 m to 60 x 60 m depending on the spectral band.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral bands\n",
    "All of the datasets listed above are captured by multispectral satellites.\n",
    "This means that the satellites measure primarily light that is reflected from the Earth's surface in discrete sections of the electromagnetic spectrum, known as *spectral bands*. \n",
    "Figure 1 shows the spectral bands for recent Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors, allowing a direct comparison of how each sensor samples the overall electromagnetic spectrum.\n",
    "Landsat 5 TM is not displayed in this image; for reference, it measured light in seven bands that covered the same regions as bands 1 to 7 on Landsat 7 ETM+.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://prd-wret.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/dmidS2LS7Comparison.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Figure 1:** The bands that are detected by each of the satellites are shown in the numbered boxes and the width of each box represents the spectral range that band detects.\n",
    "The bands are overlaid on the percentage transmission of each wavelength returned to the atmosphere from the Earth relative to the amount of incoming solar radiation. \n",
    "The y-axis has no bearing on the comparison of the satellite sensors [[source]](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/l/landsat-9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 highlights that the numbering of the bands relative to the detected wavelengths is inconsistent between sensors.\n",
    "As an example, in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum (around 560 nm), Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ detect a wide green region called band 2, where as Landsat 8 OLI detects a slightly narrower region and calls it band 3.\n",
    "Finally, Sentinel-2 MSI (A and B) detects a narrow green region but also calls it band 3.\n",
    "Consequently, when working with different sensors, it is important to understand the differences in their bands, and any impact this could have on an analysis.\n",
    "To promote awareness of these differences, DEA band naming is based on both the spectral band name and sample region.\n",
    "The naming convention will be covered in more detail in the [DEA band naming conventions section](#DEA-band-naming-conventions)."

    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Australia produces Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for each of the sensors listed above.\n",
    "The [ARD standard](http://ceos.org/ard/) for satellite data requires that data have undergone a number of processing steps, along with the creation of additional attributes for the data.\n",
    "DEA's ARD datasets include the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geometric correction:** This includes establishing ground position, accounting for terrain (orthorectification) and ground control points, and assessing absolute position accuracy. \n",
    "Geometric calibration means that imagery is positioned accurately on the Earth's surface and stacked consistently so that sequential observations can be used to track meaningful change over time.\n",
    "Adjustments for ground variability typically use a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).\n",
    "* **Surface reflectance correction:** This includes adjustments for sensor/instrument gains, biases and offsets, include adjustments for terrain illumination and sensor viewing angle with respect to the pixel position on the surface.\n",
    "Once satellite data is processed to surface reflectance, pixel values from the same sensor can be compared consistently both spatially and over time.\n",
    "* **Observation attributes:** Per-pixel metadata such as quality flags and content attribution that enable users to make informed decisions about the suitability of the products for their use. For example, clouds, cloud shadows, missing data, saturation and water are common pixel level attributes.\n",
    "* **Metadata:** Dataset metadata including the satellite, instrument, acquisition date and time, spatial boundaries, pixel locations, mode, processing details, spectral or frequency response and grid projection."

    "### Surface reflectance\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical sensors, such as those on the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites, measure light that has come from the sun and been reflected by the Earth's surface.\n",
    "The sensor measures the intensity of light in each of its spectral bands (known as \"radiance\").\n",
    "The intensity of this light is affected by many factors including the angle of the sun relative to the ground, the angle of the sensor relative to the ground, and how the light interacts with the Earth's atmosphere on its way to the sensor. \n",
    "Because radiance can be affected by so many factors, it is typically more valuable to determine how much light was originally reflected at the ground level.\n",
    "This is known as bottom-of-atmosphere **surface reflectance**.\n",
    "Surface reflectance can be calculated by using robust physical models to correct the observed radiance values based on atmospheric conditions, the angle of the sun, sensor geometry and local topography or terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches to satellite surface reflectance correction and DEA opts to use two: NBAR and NBART.\n",
    "**Users will choose which of these measurements to load when querying the DEA datacube and so it is important to understand their major similarities and differences.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NBAR\n",
    "NBAR stands for *Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance*, where BRDF stands for *Bidirectional reflectance distribution function*.\n",
    "The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute bottom-of-atmosphere radiance, and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and angular variation in reflectance.\n",
    "NBAR can be useful for analyses in extremely flat areas not affected by terrain shadow, and for producing attractive data visualisations that are not affected by NBART's nodata gaps (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NBART\n",
    "NBART has the same features of NBAR but includes an additional *terrain illumination* reflectance correction and as such considered to be actual surface reflectance as it takes into account the surface topography.\n",
    "Terrain affects optical satellite images in a number of ways; for example, slopes facing the sun receive more sunlight and appear brighter compared to those facing away from the sun.\n",
    "To obtain comparable surface reflectance from satellite images covering hilly areas, it is therefore necessary to process the images to reduce or remove the topographic effect.\n",
    "This correction is performed with a Digital Surface Model (DSM) that has been resampled to the same resolution as the satellite data being corrected.\n",
    "NBART is typically the default choice for most analyses as removing terrain illumination and shadows allows changes in the landscape to be compared more consistently across time. \n",
    "However, it can be prone to distortions in extremely flat areas if noisy elevation values exist in the DSM.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparison between NBAR and NBART](../Supplementary_data/02_DEA/nbar_nbart_animation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Figure 2:** The animation above demonstrates how the NBART correction results in a significantly more two-dimensional looking image that is less affected by terrain illumination and shadow.\n",
    "Black pixels in the NBART image represent areas of deep terrain shadow that can't be corrected as they're determined not to be viewable by either the sun or the satellite. \n",
    "These are represented by -999 `nodata` values in the data.\n"

    "### Observation Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Observation Attributes (OA)* are a suite of measurements included in DEA's analysis ready datasets.\n",
    "They are an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation of the Earth's surface, along with whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. \n",
    "The OA product allows users to exclude pixels that do not meet the quality criteria for their analysis.\n",
    "The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for analysing any change over time, since poor-quality pixels can significantly alter the percieved change over time.\n",
    "The most common use of OA is for cloud masking, where users can choose to remove images that have too much cloud, or ignore the clouds within each satellite image.\n",
    "A demonstration of how to use cloud masking can be found in the [masking data](../Frequently_used_code/Masking_data.ipynb) notebook.\n",
