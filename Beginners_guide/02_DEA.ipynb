    "### Satellite datasets \n",
    "Digital Earth Australia catalogues data from a range of satellite sensors. \n",
    "The earliest datasets of optical satellite imagery in DEA date from 1986.\n",
    "The DEA includes data from:\n",
    "* Landsat 5 TM, operational between March 1984 and January 2013\n",
    "* Landsat 7 ETM+, operational since April 1999\n",
    "* Landsat 8 OLI, operational since February 2013\n",
    "* Sentinel 2A MSI, operational since June 2015\n",
    "* Sentinel 2B MSI, operational since March 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "Landsat missions are jointly operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\n",
    "Sentinel missions are operated by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "One major difference between the two programs is the spatial resolution.\n",
    "Landsat pixel sizes represent 30 $m^{2}$ of the land surface while Sentinel pixel sizes represent 10 $m^{2}$.\n",
    "These pixels represent the smallest spatial area for which a spectra is detected at the satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the listed datasets in DEA are captured by multispectral satellites.\n",
    "This means that the satellites sample a small number of discrete sections of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n",
    "Furthermore, the datasets generated by each of these sensors (satellites) are subtly different in other ways. \n",
    "Figure 1 shows the recent Landsat satellites and Sentinel sensors and compares the way they sample the electromagnetic spectrum (Wavelength axis).\n",
    "Note that Landsat 5 TM contained 7 bands which measured the same regions as bands 1 to 7 on LS7 ETM+.\n",
    "Each sampled spectral region is called a *band*.\n",
    "It is important to note that the numbering of the bands relative to the detected wavelengths is inconsistent between sensors (Figure 1).\n",
    "For example: in the green region of the electromagnetic spectrum (around 560 nm), LS5 TM and LS7 ETM+ detect a wide green region called band 2. \n",
    "LS8 OLI detects a slightly narrower region and calls it band 3.\n",
    "Sentinel 2 MSI (A and B) detects a narrow green region but also call it band 3.\n",
    "So not only is it important to understand that the band naming changes between sensors but so too does the spectral region that is sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://prd-wret.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/dmidS2LS7Comparison.png)\n",
    "> Figure 1 [[source]](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/l/landsat-9) is overlaid upon the percent transmission of each wavelength returned to the atmosphere from the Earth relative to the amount of incoming solar radiation. \n",
    "The bands that are detected by each of the satellites are shown in the numbered boxes and the width of each box is relative to the spectral range that band detects.\n",
    "The y-axis has no bearing on the comparison of the satellite sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DEA band naming nomenclature takes sensor band naming and variability in the detected spectral region into account.\n",
    "However, before we discuss the DEA band naming conventions in more detail, it is important to understand the DEA surface reflectance measurements (NBAR and NBART), as these form an important part of the DEA band naming scheme in collection 3 of the DEA Landsat data catalogue."

    "## Surface Reflectance\n",
    "Surface reflectance provides standardised optical surface reflectance datasets using robust physical models to correct for variations in image radiance values due to atmospheric properties, and sun and sensor geometry. The resulting stack of surface reflectance grids are consistent over space and time which is instrumental in identifying and quantifying environmental change. Surface reflectance is based on radiance data from the Landsat and Sentinel sensors. Image radiance itself is a composite of surface reflectance, atmospheric condition, interaction between surface land cover, solar radiation and sensor view angle and land surface orientation relative to the imaging sensor.\n",
    "  \n",
    "There are many approaches to satellite surface reflectance correction and DEA opts to use two called NBAR and NBART.\n",
    "**Users will choose which of these measurements to load when querying the DEA datacube and so it is important to understand their major similarities and differences.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### NBAR\n",
    "Radiance measurements from EO sensors do not directly quantify the surface reflectance of the Earth. Such measurements are modified by variations in atmospheric properties, sun position, sensor view angle, surface slope and surface aspect.\n",
    "To obtain consistent and comparable measures of Earth surface reflectance from EO,these variations need to be reduced or removed from the radiance measurements (Li et al., 2010).\n",
    "This is especially important when comparing imagery acquired in different seasons and geographic regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface reflectance measurements are created using a physics-based, coupled BRDF and atmospheric correction model that can be applied to both flat and inclined surfaces (Li et al., 2012).\n",
    "The resulting surface reflectance values are comparable both within individual images and between images acquired at different times and/or with different sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "NBAR stands for *Nadir-corrected BRDF Adjusted Reflectance*, where BRDF stands for *Bidirectional reflectance distribution function*\n",
    "The approach involves atmospheric correction to compute surface-leaving radiance, and bi-directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of\n",
    "topography and angular variation in reflectance.\n",
    "### NBART\n",
    "Terrain affects optical satellite images through both irradiance and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects.\n",
    "Slopes facing the sun receive enhanced solar irradiance and appear brighter compared to those facing away from the sun.\n",
    "For anisotropic surfaces, the radiance received at the satellite sensor from a sloping surface is also affected by surface BRDF which varies with combinations of surface landcover types, sun, and satellite geometry (sun and sensor view, and their relative azimuth angle) as well as topographic geometry (primarily slope and aspect angles).\n",
    "Consequently, to obtain comparable surface reflectance from satellite images covering mountainous areas, it is necessary to process the images to reduce or remove the topographic effect so that the images can be used for different purposes on the same spectral base.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Digital Surface Model (DSM) resolution appropriate to the scale of the resolution of satellite image is needed for the best results. 1 second SRTM DSM is used for NBART processing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "NBAR-T has the same features of NBAR but includes the *terrain illumination* reflectance correction."

    "### Observation Attributes\n",
    "The *Observation Attributes (OA)* are a suite of measurements that are included in the DEA ARD datasets.\n",
    "They are an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation of the Earth surface and also whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. \n",
    "The OA product allows users to produce masks which can be used to exclude pixels which do not meet their quality criteria from analysis.\n",
    "The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for multi-temporal analysis techniques that make use of every quality assured pixel within a time series of observations.\n",
    "The most common use of OA is for cloud masking where users can choose to threshold the amound of clouds that their analysis will tolerate. \n",
    "A demonstration of how to use cloud masking can be found in the [masking data](../Frequently_used_code/Masking_data.ipynb) notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "DEA band names reference the surface reflectance correction applied (NBAR or NBART) followed by the spectral region detected by the satellite. \n",
