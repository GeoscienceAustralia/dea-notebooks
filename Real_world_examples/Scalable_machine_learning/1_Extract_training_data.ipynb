    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training data** is the most important part of any supervised machine learning workflow. The quality of the training data has a greater impact on the classification than the algorithm used. Large and accurate training data sets are preferable: increasing the training sample size results in increased classification accuracy ([Maxell et al 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2018.1433343)).  A review of training data methods in the context of Earth Observation is available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/6/1034) \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating training labels, be sure to capture the **spectral variability** of the class, and to use imagery from the time period you want to classify (rather than relying on basemap composites). Another common problem with training data is **class imbalance**. This can occur when one of your classes is relatively rare and therefore the rare class will comprise a smaller proportion of the training set. When imbalanced data is used, it is common that the final classification will under-predict less abundant classes relative to their true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many platforms to use for gathering training labels, the best one to use depends on your application. GIS platforms are great for collection training data as they are highly flexible and mature platforms; [Geo-Wiki](https://www.geo-wiki.org/) and [Collect Earth Online](https://collect.earth/home) are two open-source websites that may also be useful depending on the reference data strategy employed. Alternatively, there are many pre-existing training datasets on the web that may be useful, e.g. [Radiant Earth](https://www.radiant.earth/) manages a growing number of reference datasets for use by anyone.\n"

    "This notebook will extract training data (feature layers, in machine learning parlance) from the `open-data-cube` using labelled geometries within a geojson. The default example will use the crop/non-crop labels within the `'data/crop_training_WA.geojson'` file. This reference data was acquired and pre-processed from the USGS's Global Food Security Analysis Data portal [here](https://croplands.org/app/data/search?page=1&page_size=200) and [here](https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MEASURES/GFSAD30VAL.001/2008.01.01/).\n",

    "To do this, we rely on a custom `dea-notebooks` function called `collect_training_data`, contained within the [dea_tools.classification](../../Tools/dea_tools/classification.py) script.  The principal goal of this notebook is to familarise users with this function so they can extract the appropriate data for their use-case. The default example also highlights extracting a set of useful feature layers for generating a cropland mask forWA.\n",

    "The function `collect_training_data` takes our geojson containing class labels and extracts training data (features) from the datacube over the locations specified by the input geometries. The function will also pre-process our training data by stacking the arrays into a useful format and removing any `NaN` or `inf` values. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Collect_training_data` has the ability to generate many different types of **feature layers**. Relatively simple layers can be calculated using pre-defined parameters within the function, while more complex layers can be computed by passing in a `custom_func`. To begin with, let's try generating feature layers using the pre-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The in-built feature layer parameters are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `product`: The name of the product to extract from the datacube. In this example we use a Landsat 8 geomedian composite from 2019, `'ls8_nbart_geomedian_annual'`\n",
    "* `time`: The time range from which to extract data\n",
    "* `calc_indices`: This parameter provides a method for calculating a number of remote sensing indices (e.g. `['NDWI', 'NDVI']`). Any of the indices found in the [dea_tools.bandindices](../../Tools/dea_tools/bandindices.py) script can be used here\n",
    "* `drop`: If this variable is set to `True`, and 'calc_indices' are supplied, the spectral bands will be dropped from the dataset leaving only the band indices as data variables in the dataset.\n",
    "* `reduce_func`: The classification models we're applying here require our training data to be in two dimensions (ie. `x` & `y`). If our data has a time-dimension (e.g. if we load in an annual time-series of satellite images) then we need to collapse the time dimension.  `reduce_func` is simply the summary statistic used to collapse the temporal dimension. Options are 'mean', 'median', 'std', 'max', 'min', and 'geomedian'. In the default example we are loading a geomedian composite, so there is no time dimension to reduce.\n",
    "* `zonal_stats`: An optional string giving the names of zonal statistics to calculate across each polygon. Default is `None` (all pixel values are returned). Supported values are 'mean', 'median', 'max', and 'min'.\n",
    "* `return_coords` : If `True`, then the training data will contain two extra columns 'x_coord' and 'y_coord' corresponding to the x,y coordinate of each sample. This variable can be useful for handling spatial autocorrelation between samples later on in the ML workflow when we conduct k-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",

    "The feature layers that are most relevant for discriminating the classes of your classification problem may be more complicated than those provided in the `collect_training_data` function.  In this case, we can pass a custom feature layer function through the `custom_func` parameter. Below, we will use a custom function to recollect training data (overwriting the previous example above).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* `custom_func`: A custom function for generating feature layers. If this parameter is set, all other options (excluding 'zonal_stats'), will be ignored. The result of the 'custom_func' must be a single xarray dataset containing 2D coordinates (i.e x and y with no time dimension). The custom function has access to the datacube dataset extracted using the `dc_query` params. To load other datasets, you can use the `like=ds.geobox` parameter in `dc.load`\n",
    "\n",
    "First, lets define a custom feature layer function. This function is fairly basic and replicates some of what the `collect_training_data` function can do, but you can build these custom functions as complex as you like. We will calculate some band indices on the Landsat 8 geomedian, append the ternary median aboslute deviation dataset from the same year: [ls8_nbart_tmad_annual](https://explorer.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/products/ls8_nbart_tmad_annual/extents), and append fractional cover percentiles for the photosynthetic vegetation band, also from the same year: [fc_percentile_albers_annual](https://explorer.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/products/fc_percentile_albers_annual/extents)."
