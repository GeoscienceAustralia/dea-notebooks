Real-world examples
===================

These notebooks feature demonstrations of how Digital Earth Australia can be used to address various problems.

These notebooks should:

* Be based around a specific scientific/management/business goal/problem, and with a useful end product/output (e.g. framed around a use case/narrative)

* Present more complex workflows often involving multiple analysis steps and/or multiple datasets (ideally using techniques available in `Frequently_used_code` notebooks)
