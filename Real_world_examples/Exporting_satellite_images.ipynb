    "## Background\n",
    "Most of the case studies in this repository focus on quantitatively analysing satellite data to obtain insights into Australia's changing environment. \n",
    "However, satellite imagery also represents a powerful tool for visualisation.\n",
    "Images taken by satellites can help explain physical processes, highlight change over time, or provide valuable context to better understand the impacts of recent environmental events such as flooding or fire. \n",
    "Satellite data can also be processed to create images of the landscape based on invisible wavelengths of light (e.g. false colour images), allowing us to obtain richer insights into features and processes that would otherwise be invisible to the human eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Earth Australia use case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital Earth Australia** provides over three decades of satellite imagery across the entire continent of Australia. Satellite data from the [NASA/USGS Landsat program](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat) allow us to produce fortnightly images of Australia's diverse natural and artificial landscapes at any time since 1986. More recently, the [Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) has provided even higher resolution imagery as frequently as every 5 days since 2015. \n",

    "## Description\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive tool for selecting, loading, processing and exporting satellite imagery as a high quality image file. \n",
    "This can be used in combination with the interactive [Digital Earth Australia Maps](maps.dea.ga.gov.au) platform to identify an image of interest, then download it using this notebook for use in other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool requires no coding experience. \n",
    "It supports Sentinel-2 and Landsat data, creating True and False colour images, and advanced features like applying pansharpening to increase the resolution of Landsat 7 and 8 imagery, power transformations to darken bright features, or unsharp masking to sharpen imagery.\n",
