    "## Background\n",
    "Most of the case studies in this repository focus on quantitatively analysing satellite data to obtain insights into Australia's changing environment. \n",
    "However, satellite imagery can also be used as a powerful tool for visualisation, particularly within dynamic environments that have changed significantly over the past ~30 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Animations produced from satellite images can help explain dynamic physical processes, highlight change over time, or provide valuable context to better understand the impacts of recent environmental events such as flooding or fire. \n",
    "Satellite animations can also be processed to create images of the landscape based on invisible wavelengths of light (e.g. false colour images), allowing us to obtain richer insights into features and processes that would otherwise be invisible to the human eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Earth Australia use case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital Earth Australia** provides over three decades of satellite imagery across the entire continent of Australia. Satellite data from the [NASA/USGS Landsat program](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat) allow us to produce fortnightly images of Australia's diverse natural and artificial landscapes at any time since 1986. More recently, the [Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) has provided even higher resolution imagery as frequently as every 5 days since 2015. \n",

    "* `Frame interval`: The frame rate used to animate the satellite data. \n",
    "Values are in milliseconds - larger values will produce a longer, slower animation.\n",
    "* `Resolution`: The spatial resolution to load data (in metres). By default, the tool will automatically set the best possible resolution depending on the satellites selected (i.e. 30 m for Landsat, 10 m for Sentinel-2). \n",
    "Increasing this (e.g. to `100`) can be useful for loading large spatial extents.\n",
    "* `Width of output animation`: The width of the animation MP4 or GIF file in pixels. This can be used to produce a HD video, but won't increase the resolution of the input satellite imagery (setting a high value will produce a larger animation, but may introduce unwanted pixelation).\n",
    "* `Apply temporal resampling`: Whether to combine multiple satellite images into time period median composite images. Available options are None, monthly, quarterly and annually.\n",
    "* `Mask out cloudy pixels`: Whether to mask out cloudy pixels with `nodata` to remove them from the animation. This is best used in combination with a rolling median or temporal resampling, as otherwise it will introduce large areas of black `nodata` pixels in the animation.\n",
    "* `Add DEA Coastlines overlay`: Whether to add annual shoreline vectors from the Digital Earth Australia Coastlines product as an overlay on top of the animation.\n",
    "* `Apply power transformation`: Raises imagery by a power to reduce bright features and enhance dark features. \n",
    "This can add extra definition over areas with extremely bright features like snow, beaches or salt pans.\n",
    "* `Apply unsharp masking` Whether to apply unsharp masking to increase the sharpness of the output image. \n",
    "If activated, you can specify both the radius (in pixels) and the amount/strength of the sharpening.\n",
    "* `Override maximum size limit`: Whether to override the app's default 500 square km area limit.\n",
    "This can be used to load larger areas of satellite imagery, but should be used with caution as it can lead to memory issues or crashes.\n",
