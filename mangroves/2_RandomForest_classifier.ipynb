    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will classify the major classes of the intertidal zone (e.g. mangroves, clay-pans and salt marshes) using the annual geomedians and summary statistics produced by the script `TidallyFilteredComposites.ipynb` and a Random Forest Classifier. The workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import training data\n",
    "2. Fit a model\n",
    "3. Classify an image\n",
    "4. Assess feature importance\n",
    "5. Assess RF parameters\n",
    "6. Export tree diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyses used: `Random Forest Classfication`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "There are a number of very important things to consider when attempting to use a Random Forest Classifier.  Consider the following before running this analysis (most of this info has been gleaned from the following review article [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2018.1433343).  Some more general information about the Random Forest algorithm is available [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/10/random-forests-explained.html)\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Training data:**\n",
    "     - The most important part of any machine learning workflow. The quality of the training data has a greater impact of the classification than the algorithm used. Large and accurate training data sets are preferable: increasing the training sample size results in increased classification accuracy (Huang, Davis and Townsend 2002).\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - When creating training data, be sure to capture the spectral variability of the class. The best way to create training data is using a GIS platform. If you have access to ArcGIS Pro, there is a new tool that facilitates the easy capture of training data, and includes useful features like adjusting for class imbalance (see below). The tool collection is [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/image-analyst/training-samples-manager.htm).\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Random Forest (RF) classifiers are moderately robust to miss-classifications in the training data, as long as the errors are < 10-20 %\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - _Class imbalance:_ This can occurs when one of your classes is relatively rare and therefore the rare class will comprise a smaller proprotion of the training set. When imbalanced data is used, it is common that the final classification will under-predict less abundant classes relative to their true proportion. This is especially relevant to a RF classifier as the algorithm attempts to minimize error by testing overall accuracy, and the miss-classifications of rare classes do not substantially drop the overall error rate compared to optimising a very common class.\n",
    "     \n",
    "         - An approach to solving this problem can be to create a training data set, and then conduct an equalized randomly sampling strategy to select an equal number of grid cells in each class. If this approach is impossible because a class just has too few pixels, you can instead undersample the majority class, or oversample the minority class by duplicating records of the minority class.\n",
    "         \n",
    "  \n",
    " - **RF user-defined parameters:**\n",
    "   - One of the advantages of the RF classifiers is they are relatively easy to optimize.  The number of trees is the most important parameter. 100 is considered a minimum, and 500 is considered a conservative maximum.\n",
    "   - Use the `Test parameter values of RF model` section of the script to assess optimizations for other parameters."
