Index Calculation
=================

These pages demonstrate how to calculate indices with DEA datasets, such as

- NDVI
- Tasseled cap
- Mineral indices

The examples provided here can be found as Jupyter Notebooks in the `dea-notebooks Github repository <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks>`_. Note that these functions have been developed by DEA users, not the DEA development team, and so are provided without warranty. If you find an error or bug in the functions, please either create an Issue in the Github repository, or fix it yourself and create a Pull request to contribute the updated function back into the repository (See the repository README for instructions on creating a Pull request).
