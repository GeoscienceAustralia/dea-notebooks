Once the `Zonal Statistics` plugin has been installed, select it via *Raster>Zonal statistics>Zonal statistics*. In the '*Zonal Statistics*' dialogue box select the wind speed raster for a particular cyclone under the *'Raster layer:'* drop down menu. Under the *'Polygon layer containing the zones:'* drop down menu, select the new `1kmGridMangrovesfinal.shp` duplicate file that was saved earlier. From the *'Statistics to calculate:'* menu select *'Standard deviation'* and *'Maximum'* and any other desired statistics. Click OK.\n",

    "The shapefile created above will now have zonal statistics for all mangrove tiles that are contained within the wind speed raster. One way of creating shapefiles for each wind speed category is to firstly duplicate the shapefile created in the previous step. Then, open the attributes table and select the data that falls within a wind speed range for a desired category. This can be done by checking the new `Maximum` column, which was created during the `Zonal Statistics` step. The remaining data can be deleted. This will leave you with a shapefile with the 1km mangrove tiles that have experienced the chosen wind speed category. This step can be repeated to create shapefiles for each area that has been subjceted to certain wind speed categories for a given cyclone. Rename new shapefiles according to their wind speed categories. \n",
