    "# Tiled, Parallel Image Segmentation \n",

    "<b>What does this notebook do?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation at large scales can be both time and memory intensive. The module ['tiledSegParallel.py'](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/tree/master/10_Scripts/tiledSegParallel.py) builds upon the image segmentation algorithm developed by Shepherd et al. (2019) (implemented in the package RSGISlib) to run image segmentation across multiple cpus. A full description of their approach can be found in _Clewey et al. (2014) A Python-Based Open Source System for Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) Utilizing Raster Attribute Tables_. This notebook implements the 'tiledSegParallel.py' module to conduct an image semgmentation on a large geotiff (8gb, approximately 50 Albers tiles).  The results of the notebook include a segments ('Clumps') geotiff, and a geotiff with the segments attributed with the zonal mean of the input geotiff. This script takes ~ 1.5 hours to run on a geotiff of this scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Requirements</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to run the following commands from the command line prior to launching jupyter notebooks from the same terminal so that the required libraries and paths are set:\n",
    "\n",
    "    module use /g/data/v10/public/modules/modulefiles\n",
    "    module load dea\n",
    "\n",
    "This script also requires the installation of 'pathos.multiprocessing', a fork of python's Multiprocessing package that using Dill instead of Pickle for serializing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install --user pathos\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cautions</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major caveats to the use of this script:\n",
    "1. As the script uses the Multiprocessing library, it cannot be run across multiple nodes. If running on Raijin, using queues that have a large number of cpus per node would be best. A 'raijinified' version of the script can be found [here](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/blob/chad/segmentation/parallel_segmentation.py).\n",
    "2. The tiling approach is based on the bounding coordinates of the geotiff. If a geotiff is irregularly shaped such that a tile(s) contains _none_ of the input geotiff, then the segmentation will fail. If this occurs, check the ..._S1Tiles.shp_ file output during stage 1 of the algorithm. Overlay this file on top of your input geotiff to check if there are empty tiles. At the moment, the only solution is to change the extent of the geotiff to be more regularly shaped.  The 'validDataTileFraction' variable will handle tiles that contain a small fraction of the input geotiff, tiles containing less than the specified fraction are merged with a neighboring tile.  The image below shows an example of the tiling approach with merged tiles:\n",
