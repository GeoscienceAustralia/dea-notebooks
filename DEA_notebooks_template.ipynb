    "### General advice (delete this cell before submitting for review)\n",
    "\n",
    "> * When choosing a location for your analysis, **select an area that has data on both the NCI and DEA Sandbox** to allow your code to be run on both environments. \n",
    "For example, you can check this for Landsat using the [DEA Explorer](https://explorer.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/ga_ls5t_ard_3/1990) (use the drop-down menu to view all products).\n",
    "As of September 2019, the `DEA Sandbox` has a single year of continental Landsat data for 2015-16, and the full 1987-onward time-series for three locations (Perth WA, Brisbane QLD, and western NSW).\n",
    "> * When adding **Products used**, embed the hyperlink to that specific product on the DEA Explorer using the `[product_name](product url)` syntax.\n",
    "> * When writing in Markdown cells, start each sentence on a **new line**.\n",
    "This makes it easy to see changes through git commits.\n",
    "> * Use Australian English in markdown cells and code comments.\n",
    "> * Check the [known issues](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-docs/wiki/Known-issues) for formatting regarding the conversion of notebooks to DEA docs using Sphinx.\n",
    "Things to be aware of:\n",
    "    * Sphinx is highly sensitive to bulleted lists:\n",
    "        * Ensure that there is an empty line between any preceding text and the list\n",
    "        * Only use the `*` bullet (`-` is not recognised)\n",
    "        * Sublists must be indented by 4 spaces\n",
    "    * Two kinds of formatting cannot be used simultaneously:\n",
    "        * Hyperlinked code: \\[\\`code_format\\`](hyperlink) fails\n",
    "        * Bolded code: \\*\\*\\`code_format\\`\\*\\* fails\n",
    "    * Headers must appear in heirachical order (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) and there can only be one title (`#`).\n",
    "> * Use the [PEP8 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code. To make sure all code in the notebook is consistent, you can use the `jupyterlab_code_formatter` tool: select each code cell, then click `Edit` and then one of the `Apply X Formatter` options (`YAPF` or `Black` are recommended). This will reformat the code in the cell to a consistent style.\n",
    "> * For additional guidance, refer to the style conventions and layouts in approved `develop` branch notebooks. \n",
    "Examples include\n",
    "    * [Frequently_used_code/Using_load_ard.ipynb](./Frequently_used_code/Using_load_ard.ipynb)\n",
    "    * [Real_world_examples/Coastal_erosion.ipynb](./Real_world_examples/Coastal_erosion.ipynb)\n",
    "    * [Scripts/dea_datahandling.py](./Scripts/dea_datahandling.py)\n",
    "> * In the final notebook cell, include a set of relevant tags which are used to build the DEA User Guide's [Tag Index](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/genindex.html). \n",
    "Use all lower-case (unless the tag is an acronym), separate words with spaces (unless it is the name of an imported module), and [re-use existing tags](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/wiki/List-of-tags).\n",
    "Ensure the tags cell below is in `Raw` format, rather than `Markdown` or `Code`.\n"
