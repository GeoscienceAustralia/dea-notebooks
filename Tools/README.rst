dea-tools
=========

Python functions and algorithms developed to assist in analysing DEA data (e.g. loading data, plotting, spatial analysis, machine learning).

Installation
------------

To work with this module on the DEA Sandbox from within the `dea-notebooks` repo, you can add the Tools folder to the system path:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   sys.path.insert(1, '../Tools/')
   import dea_tools.datahandling  # or some other submodule

You can also `pip install` the module. To do this on the DEA Sandbox, run `pip` from the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e Tools/

Install from the source on any other system with `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --extra-index-url="https://packages.dea.ga.gov.au" git+https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks.git#subdirectory=Tools

Building and Releasing
----------------------

This section is only relevant to you if you are a developer of this package.

Building and releasing dea-tools requires that the package is built in-place. Either build with an editable pip installation or with `pip>=21.2` and `--use-feature=in-tree-build`. Building will generate a file, `dea_tools/__version__.py`, that is dynamic on release. It should not be committed. `setup.py` will detect if `__version__.py` exists and change its behaviour accordingly.

Build instructions:

.. code-block:: bash

        cd Tools
        rm dea_tools/__version__.py  # if necessary
        pip install . --use-feature=in-tree-build
        python -m build
