    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Wetlands provide a wide range of ecosystem services including improving water quality, carbon sequestration, as well as providing habitat for fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds.  Managing wetlands in Australia is challenging due to competing pressures for water availability and highly variable climatic settings.  The DEA Wetlands Insight Tool has been developed to provide catchment managers, environmental water holders, and wetlands scientists a consistent historical baseline of wetlands dynamics from 1987 onwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DEA Wetlands Insight Tool summarises how the amount of water, green vegetation, dry vegetation and bare soil varies over time within each wetland. It provides the user with the ability to compare how the wetland is behaving now with how it has behaved in the past.  This allows users to identify how changes in water availability have affected the wetland. It achieves this by presenting a combined view of Water Observations from Space, Tasseled Cap Wetness and Fractional Cover measurements from the Landsat series of satellites, summarised as a stacked line plot to show how that wetland has changed over time.

    "## Applications\n",
    "The product is designed to support wetland managers, catchment managers and environmental waterholders in understanding whether or not wetlands are changing over time.  In instances where the wetlands are changing, the tool allows users to identify whether the changes are gradual, rapid, once-off or cyclical in nature.  For example the response of wetlands to the following drivers can be assessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Changes in river flow volumes\n",
    "* Changes in flood frequency\n",
    "* Long term shifts in rainfall\n",
    "* Wet-season/Dry-season shifts in water availability\n",
    "* Invasive weeds\n",
    "* Environmental watering events\n",
    "\n",
    "Care should be used when interpreting Wetlands Insight Tool results as increases/decreases in particular cover types can be associated with different processes.  For example an increase in green cover could indicate canopy recovery of desirable wetland species or an increase in the amount of invasive weeds.\n",

    "## Calculate Tasseled Cap Wetness from the Landsat data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Tasseled Cap Wetness (TCW) to identify areas in wetlands that are wet, but not identified by the WOfS algorithm as open water. This includes areas of mixed vegetation and water like in palustrine wetlands. TCW is the third component of a Tasseled Cap Index analysis and can be thresholded to classify wet pixels (Fisher et al., [2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.055)). Tasseled Cap Index analysis is a linear principal component analysis of Landsat imagery with a Procrustes’ Rotation (Kauth and Thomas, [1976](http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/lars_symp/159)), producing three components roughly corresponding to brightness (TCB), greenness (TCG) and wetness (TCW; Roberts et al., 2018). The coefficients of Crist ([1985](https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(85)90102-6)) were used to calculate TCW. \n",
    "\n",
    "TCW has values between −12,915 and 7032 when applied to DEA Landsat data. As TCW increases, the pixel becomes \n",
    "wetter, with open water having TCW values near and above zero (Pasquarella et al., [2016](https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.24)). We threshold TCW at −350, with values above this threshold used to characterise ‘wet’ pixels. We developed the TCW threshold to identify ‘wet’ pixels by comparing TCW to known inundation extents in the Macquarie Marshes, a large floodplain wetland in the Murray-Darling Basin of south-eastern Australia. We chose the threshold for the WIT workflow to minimise the absolute difference in extent between the observed inundated area and the area of thresholded TCW as described further here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13157-023-01682-7#appendices\n"
