       "## DEA High and Low Tide Imagery\n",
       "### Background\n",
       "<p>Intertidal zones are those which are exposed to the air at low tide and underwater at high tide. These include sandy beaches, tidal flats, rocky shores and reefs.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Intertidal zones form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms, but are faced with increasing threats, including coastal erosion and a rise in sea levels.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The ever-changing nature of the tides makes it hard to systematically capture consistent imagery of the intertidal zone, particularly across large regions. Pressure is mounting on this zone from sea-level rise and anthropogenic sources such as land reclamation and aquaculture.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "### What this product offers\n",
       "<p>This product is a suite of cloud-free composite imagery of the intertidal zones at high and low tide around the Australian coast. It calculates the geometric median (geomedian) of the highest and lowest 20% of the observed tidal range in Digital Earth Australia (DEA)’s archive of Landsat satellite images.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>To generate these composites, the archive of Landsat images has been paired with regional tidal modelling, generated by Oregon State Tidal Prediction software. This allows the archive to be sorted by tide height rather than date, so the intertidal zone can be visualised at any stage of the tide regime.  </p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The data has been captured on a 25m spatial scale.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "### Applications\n",
       "<ul><li>Mapping cover types within the intertidal zone</li>\n",
       "\t<li>Visualising the full observed extent of the tidal range around the Australian continental coastline</li>\n",
       "</ul>\n",
