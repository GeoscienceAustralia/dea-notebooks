    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Land cover is the observed physical cover on the Earth's surface, including trees, shrubs, grasses, soils, exposed rocks, water bodies, plantations, crops and built structures.\n",
    "Land cover changes for many reasons, including seasonal weather, severe weather events, and human activities.\n",
    "Remote sensing data recorded over time allows the observation of land cover dynamics.\n",
    "DEA Land Cover aims to provide a national land cover data set that places current land cover status and changes into a historical context at a national, regional and local scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this product offers\n",
    "\n",
    "[Digital Earth Australia Land Cover (DEA Land Cover)](https://cmi.ga.gov.au/data-products/dea/607/dea-land-cover-landsat) is a continental dataset that maps  annual land cover classifications for Australia from 1988 to the present. \n",
    "DEA Land Cover is at a 25 m resolution, meaning each pixel represents a 25 m × 25 m area on the ground. \n",
    "Each pixel shows the predominant land cover condition for the selected year.\n",
    "The product combines Landsat satellite data and related data products from Geoscience Australia's [Digital Earth Australia](https://www.dea.ga.gov.au/) program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classification system used in DEA Land Cover follows the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [land cover classification taxonomy](https://www.fao.org/land-water/land/land-governance/land-resources-planning-toolbox/category/details/en/c/1036361/), allowing for comparison and integration with other national and international datasets. \n",
    "The product defines six base land cover classes (Level 3), seven land cover environmental descriptors, and a final land cover classification (Level 4) that combines both base classes and environmental descriptors.\n",
    "More information about each class can be found further down in this notebook (see **Plotting data**), and on the [DEA Land Cover product details](https://cmi.ga.gov.au/data-products/dea/607/dea-land-cover-landsat#details) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "DEA Land Cover allows users to analyse land cover over a range of spatial, temporal and thematic scales. \n",
    "Scientists, resource managers and policymakers can use the product to support environmental monitoring, emergency management, sustainable natural resource management, and more.\n",
    "Specific examples include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environmental monitoring:** ecosystem mapping, understanding surface water dynamics, erosion management \n",
    "* **Primary industries:** understanding crop responses to water availability, understanding and mitigating impact of drought, monitoring vegetation change\n",
    "* **Community interests:** mapping urban expansion, mapping impacts of natural disasters, bushfire recovery.\n",

    "* <strong>216: Natural bare surface</strong>  \n",
    "Natural bare surface is mostly soil. It is very likely that there is still vegetation in the area, but it is dominated by soil.\n",
