DEA datasets
============

These notebooks are designed to introduce the datasets available through Digital Earth Australia.

These notebooks should include:

* Background information about the product and why it is necessary (this can be harvested from DEA's Content Management Interface: https://cmi.ga.gov.au/node)

* A simple example of how to load the data

* Information on any special features of the data (e.g. important attributes or bands) and any important steps that must be considered to conduct valid analyses (e.g. PQ fusers, group_by etc)

* Where possible, aim at beginner to intermediate users who may not be familar with technical remote sensing terminology
