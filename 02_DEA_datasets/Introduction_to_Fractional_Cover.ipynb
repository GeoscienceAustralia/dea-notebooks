    "## What is Fractional Cover? [[1, 2](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Landsat Fractional Cover product stored in DEA is at 25m x 25m resolution (the same as the Landsat surface reflectance products).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractional Cover represents the proportion of the land surface\n",
    "that is bare (BS), covered by photosynthetic vegetation (PV), or non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Fractional Cover product was generated using the spectral unmixing algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) [[2](#References)] which used the spectral signature for each pixel to break it up into three fractions, based on field work that determined the spectral characteristics of these fractions. [[1](#References)]The fractions were retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model.[[1](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The green (PV) fraction includes leaves and grass, the non-photosynthetic fraction (NPV) includes branches, dry grass and dead leaf litter, and the bare soil (BS) fraction includes bare soil or rock.[[1](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fractional Cover Bands: [[1](#References)]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bare Soil (bare ground, rock, disturbed) (BS):**  - Bare Ground (bare soil, rock) percentage; Digital Number 10000 = 100%\n",

    "- **Non-Photosythetic vegetation (litter, dead leaf and branches) (NPV):** - Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (litter, dead leaves andbranches) percentage; Digital Number 10000 = 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unmixing Error (UE):**  - Unmixing Error. The residual error, defined as the Euclidean Norm of the Residual Vector. High values express less confidence in the fractional components.\n",
    "    \n",
    "__No Data Values:__ Fractional cover contains no data values (-1)\n",
    "we use the datacube storage function \"masking.mask_invalid_data\" to remove these from our data before using the data\n",

    "### Limitations, Errors and Uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Water and soil moisture:__\n",
    "Pixels over water may show incorrect values for Photosynthetic Vegetation. [[1](#References)] Water should be masked out, maybe by using WOfS or a water index. Soil moisture may affect the accuracy of the product [[1](#References)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Sums greater than 100%:__\n",
    "\"Occasionally the sum of the three components is not equal to 100%. Differences are usually small and are not rounded in order to preserve what may be useful seasonal indicators. \"[[1](#References)]\n",
