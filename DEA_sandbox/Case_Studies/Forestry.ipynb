    "### Background\n",
    "Effective management of Australia's forests is critical for balancing environmental protection and sustainable growth of the industry.\n",
    "Methods for detecting meaningful and significant change in forests are important for those who manage and monitor large areas of forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "On-the-ground monitoring can be expensive and time-consuming, especially when forests are in difficult-to-navigate terrain.\n",
    "Aerial photography and LiDAR can provide detailed information about forests, but are often extremely expensive to acquire, even over small areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentinel-2 use case\n",
    "Satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 is freely available and has a revisit time over Australia of 3-5 days.\n",
    "Its 10 metre resolution makes it perfect for monitoring fine changes over very large areas of land.\n",
    "The archive of Sentinel-2 data stretches back to 2015, meaning that there is a good amount of data for change detection, allowing one to average out or focus on seasonal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we measure the presence of vegetation from Sentinel-2 imagery and apply a hypothesis test to identify areas of significant change (along with the direction of the change).\n",
    "The worked example takes users through the code required to do the following:\n",
    "1. Load cloud-free Sentinel-2 images for an area of interest\n",
    "2. Compute an index to highlight presence of vegetation (NDVI)\n",
    "3. Apply a statistical hypothesis test to find areas of significant change\n",
    "4. Visualise the statistically significant areas."
