    "### Background\n",
    "Inland waterbodies are essential for supporting human life, both through the supply of drinking water and the support of agriculture and aquaculture.\n",
    "Such waterbodies can be contaminated by outbreaks of blue-green (and other toxic) algae, causing health issues for people and animals.\n",
    "For example, up to a million fish died during an [algal bloom event](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-08/second-fish-kill-in-darling-river-at-menindee/10696632) in the Darling river in late 2018 and early 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "While the health of waterbodies can be monitored from the ground through sampling, satellite imagery can complement this, potentially improving the detection of large algal bloom events.\n",
    "However, there needs to be a well-understood and tested way to link satellite observations to the presence of algal blooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentinel-2 use case\n",
    "Algal blooms are associated with the presence of clorophyll-*a* in waterbodies.\n",
    "[Mishra and Mishra (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2011.10.016) developed the normalised difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), which serves as a qualitative indicator for the concentration of clorophyll-*a* on the surface of a waterbody.\n",
    "The index requires information from a specific part of the infrared specturm, known as the 'red edge'. \n",
    "This is captured as part of Sentinel-2's 13 spectral bands, making it possible to measure the NDCI with Sentinel-2. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we measure the NDCI for one of the Menindee Lakes, which was strongly affected by the algal bloom event mentioned in the Background section.\n",
    "This is combined with information about the size of the waterbody, which is used to build a helpful visualisation of how the water-level and presence of chlorophyll-*a* changes over time.\n",
    "The worked example takes users through the code required to:\n",
    "1. Load cloud-free Sentinel-2 images for an area of interest.\n",
    "2. Compute indices to measure the presence of water and clorophyll-*a*.\n",
    "3. Generate informative visualisations to identify the presence of clorophyll-*a*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some caveats\n",
    "- The NDCI is currently treated as an experimental index for Australia, as futher work is needed to calibrate and validate how well the index relates to the presence of clorophyll-*a*. \n",
    "- It is also important to remember that algal blooms will usually result in increased values of the NDCI, but not all NDCI increases will be from algal blooms.\n",
    "For example, there may be seasonal fluctuations in the amount of clorophyll-*a* in a waterbody.\n",
    "- Further validation work is required to understand how shallow water and atmospheric effects affect the NDCI, and its use in identifying high concentrations of clorophyll-*a*."
