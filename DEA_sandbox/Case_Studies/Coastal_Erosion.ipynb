    "# Coastal Erosion Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Over 40% of the worldâ€™s population lives within 100 km of the coastline. However, coastal environments are constantly changing, with erosion and coastal change presenting a major challenge to valuable coastal infrastructure and important ecological habitats. Up-to-date data on coastal change and erosion is essential for coastal managers to be able to identify and minimise the impacts of coastal change and erosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "Monitoring coastlines and rivers using field surveys can be challenging and hazardous, particularly at regional or national scale. Aerial photography and LiDAR can be used to monitor coastal change, but this is often expensive and requires many repeated flights over the same areas of coastline to build up an accurate history of how the coastline has changed across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Digital Earth Australia use case\n",
    "Imagery from satellites such as the NASA/USGS Landsat program is available for free for the entire planet, making satellite imagery a powerful and cost-effective tool for monitoring coastlines and rivers at regional or national scale. By identifying and extracting the precise boundary between water and land based on satellite data, it is possible to extract accurate shorelines that can be compared across time to reveal hotspots of erosion and coastal change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usefulness of satellite imagery in the coastal zone can be affected by the presence of clouds, sun-glint over water, poor water quality (e.g. sediment) and the influence of tides. The effect of these factors can be reduced by combining individual noisy images into cleaner \"summary\" or composite layers, and filtering the data to focus only on images taken at certain tidal conditions (e.g. high tide). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we combine data from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites with image compositing and tide filtering techniques to accurately map shorelines across time, and identify areas that have changed significantly between 1988 and 2018. The worked example takes users through the code required to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Load in a cloud-free Landsat time series\n",
    "2.  Compute a water index (MNDWI)\n",
    "3.  Filter images by tide height\n",
    "4.  Create \"summary\" or composite images for given time periods\n",
    "5.  Extract and visualise shorelines across time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* Products used: `ga_ls5t_ard_3`, `ga_ls7e_ard_3`, `ga_ls8c_ard_3`\n",
    "* Bands used: `red`, `green`, `blue` and `swir1`. You can read more about the bands available for Landsat [here](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/landsat-8-bands/)\n",
    "* Analyses used: MNDWI water index, tide modelling, image compositing, waterline extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run this analysis, run all the cells in the notebook, starting with the \"Load modules\" cell. When you finished the analysis, you can return to the \"Set up analysis\" cell, modify some values (e.g. choose a different location, time, tide height range or time period to analyse) and re-run the analysis. There are additional instructions on modifying the notebook at the end.**"

We can also set two other important parameters: `tide_range` allows us to extract shorelines based on satellite images taken only at certain part of the tide range (e.g. at low or high tide). This can be useful for seperating the effect of erosion from the influence of tides.
