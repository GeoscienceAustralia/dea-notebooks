    "When working with radar data, water commonly appears dark; its relatively smooth surface results in very little backscatter, and consequently, low intensities recorded by the satellite in both polarisation bands. However, if a large ship is on the water, the backscatter at the ship's location will be much higher than the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we attempt to identify shipping lanes around Australia by taking advantage of the fact that ships on the water result in a significant backscatter signal. This can be done by finding the maximum of each pixel in Sentinel-1 images. Computing the maximum for a large number of pixel is computationally expensive, so we make use of the parallel-computing library [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/).\n",
