    "Loading data from the [Digital Earth Australia (DEA)](https://www.ga.gov.au/dea) instance of the [Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) requires the construction of a data query that specifies the what, where, and when of the data request.\n",

    "It is essential to understand the `xarray` data structures as they are fundamental to the structure of data loaded from the datacube.\n",
