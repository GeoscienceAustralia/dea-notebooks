Changes to WOfS 1.6.5
################################

Some small changes to the input bands have been made to accommodate S2 inputs for testing. This was completed in wofls.py Line 91, replacing nbart_nir with nbart_nir_1 and nbart_nir2, and nbart_swir_1 and nbart_swir2 with nbart_swir_2 and nbart_swir_3 respectively. No other changes are required.
