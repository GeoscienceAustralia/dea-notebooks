    "- This analysis involves less data than a full temporal integration (1987-2018), with little discernible impact on the results, and so minimises compute required\n",
    "- Focusing the analysis on more recent years increases the likelihood of newly created waterbodies to be identified. Newer waterbodies will have fewer total wet observations. Performing the analysis over a shorter time period means that when the total number of wet observations are divided by the total number of clear observations (to produce frequency statistics), the frequency of wet observations will be higher, and therefore, the waterbody is more likely to be included in the final results.
