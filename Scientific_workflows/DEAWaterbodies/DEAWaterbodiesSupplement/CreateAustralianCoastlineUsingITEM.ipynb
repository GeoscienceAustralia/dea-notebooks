    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A land/sea mask is required to filter out [DEA Waterbody polygons](../TurnWaterObservationsIntoWaterbodyPolygons.ipynb) associated with oceans and estuaries. The [GEODATA COAST 100K 2004](https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/61395) dataset was initially used  for this mask, however there were discrepancies between the mapped coastline of Australia and the coastline as observed by Landsat, which meant that some waterbodies that are associated with ocean or estuaries were not correctly filtered out (and some were incorrectly filtered out as well). \n",
    "\n",

    "There are a number of polygons generated as a result of artifacts in the ITEM dataset (like the one highlighted above). In order to clean up those artifacts, we removed any polygons from our ITEM coastline that did not intersect/overlap in some way with a polygons from the OZCOASTS dataset. This may result in some valid island polygons being removed, but is a quick way to quality control the ITEM Coastline polygon set. We did this analysis in QGIS using the `select by location` tool (so we could quickly visually check the results), but it could have been done in python using a spatial join. "
